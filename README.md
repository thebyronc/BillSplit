JavaScript Week 4 - Creating a clean and polished application.

## Personal Development
Explore creating a clean and functional application that I personally will be using on a regular basis. Current concern is that all the applications I've made up to this point has only been exercises for a concept.

### Application Bill-Splitter
This might be a larger undertaking, but this will be one of my main goals out of Epicodus. Creating a functional bill splitting app that I and others will want to use is going to be a struggle for finding and tackling bugs and inconsistencies.
